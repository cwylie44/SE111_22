               As someone that doesn't watch many movies, this movie was an excellent watch. It had plenty of action and made you actually feel a connection to the characters, unlike many movies.
               The actors also did phenomenal jobs at filing the characters they were playing and certainly added to the atmosphere of the film.<br><br>
             
               The run time being a little on the longer time really didn't reflect so. The movie was so engaging it flew by while fitting in a lot of overall content.
               The effects throughout the movie also were on point as there was nothing done wrong that jumped out at you. <br> <br>
               I personally would give <em>The Dark Knight</em> a 10/10.<br><br>
