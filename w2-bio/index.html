            <h2><b>Biography</b></h2> <!--This is my biography-->
            <p>His name is Cody Wylie and he is 20 years old. He was born in Warwick, Rhode Island, although mostly raised by his father in Narragansett, Rhode Island. He moved around a little bit as a kid so he had been to a few different schools at a young age.
               He has accomplished a few things so far in his lifetime, most notably, he has graduated high school, won a few awards through track and of course, is forklift certified. When it comes to job history, he has worked at Iggys, Aunt Carries, Amgen, 
               Narragansett School Systems, Applebees, Matunuck Oyster Bar, Plum Point Bistro, Mews Tavern and the legendary Dominos. Characteristically, he is a pretty laid back guy, athletic, intelligent and pretty handsome (well at least according to his grandmother).
