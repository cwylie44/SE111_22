       <p>My name is Cody Wylie and I'm 20 years old. I was born in Warwick, Rhode Island, although mostly raised by my father in Narragansett, Rhode Island. I moved around quite a bit as a kid so I had been to a few different schools at a young age.
         I have accomplished a few things so far in my lifetime, I have graduated high school, won a few awards through track and of course, am forklift certified. When it comes to job history, I have worked at Iggys, Aunt Carries, Amgen, 
         Narragansett School Systems, Applebees, Matunuck Oyster Bar, Plum Point Bistro, Mews Tavern and the legendary Dominos. Characteristically, I'm a pretty laid back guy, athletic, intelligent and pretty handsome (well at least according to my grandma). Thats all there really is to know about me.
